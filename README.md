In review. Data Descriptor: the Australian Shark-Incident Database for quantifying temporal and spatial patterns of shark-human conflict. _Scientific Data_

The Excel workbook '<strong>Australian Shark-Incident Database_Public Version.xlsx</strong>' contains the living file that will be updated regularly by collaborators. The column descriptors are as follows:
